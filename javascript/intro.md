## Chrome console
* Open up any website in chrome and inspect. Show the HTML markup. Then open up the console log.

## Data Types

JS is a loosely typed language. Meaning the programmer does not have to declare the type of data contained in a variable.

## Primitive Data Types

The basic data types are:
- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Null
- Symbol

For now, we will focus on numbers, strings, and booleans.


### Numbers

Numbers can be integers (positive, negative or zero) as well as fractions of a whole number. Fractions are written as a decimal and are called a float.

##### Arithmetic

We can perform mathematical calculations with numbers in JavaScript in the Chrome console.

```JavaScript
1           -> 1
1.0         -> 1

addition
2 + 2       -> 4
0.1 + 0.2   -> 0.3
3.7 + 5     -> 8.7

subtraction
2 - 2       -> 0

multiplication
2 * 2       -> 4

division
2 / 2       -> 1
2 / 0       -> Infinity
-2 / 0      -> -Infinity

modulo
2 % 2       -> 0
3 % 2       -> 1
18 % 5      -> 3

exponents
7 ** 2      -> 49
```
### Strings

We can store words or other characters in JavaScript by surrounding characters with quotation marks. Anything can be written as a string if it is surrounded by quotation marks. Single or double quotes don't matter in JS, as long as you are consistent throughout your program. As a best practice, consider sticking to double quotes for now.

##### Concatenation

When we but a + between two strings, it combines them in a process called concatenation.

```
"hell" + "o"        -> "hello"
"hello " + "world"  -> "hello world"
"3 + 4"             -> "3 + 4"
"3 + 4" + "5"       -> "3 + 45"
```

##### Built-in String Functions/Methods

The JavaScript language has some pre-made functionality that can be used on the strings called built-in functions.

```
"hello".charAt(1)       -> "e"
"hello".length          -> 5
"hello".includes("he")  -> true
```

A function is a JavaScript procedure - or a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it (unless it is built-in).


JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.

Take time to look into JS built-in string methods.

### Boolean

Boolean expressions in JavaScript return `true` or `false`. Even though true and false are words, they are not strings. They represent the _value_ of true/false.

```
true                 -> true
false                -> false
```

##### Comparison Operators
Comparison operators will return a Boolean value.

```
equality operator
true == false       -> false
3 == "3"            -> true

strict comparison
true === false      -> false
3 === "3"           -> false
```
##### Relational operators
Relational operators return a Boolean value.

```
greater than
2 > 0               -> true

less than
4 < 8               -> true

greater than or equal to
0 >= 2              -> false

less than or equal to
-4 <= 0.8           -> true
```
##### Logical Operators
Logical operators can return any type of data but uses the principle of Boolean data type to determine the outcome.

```
and
true && false       -> false
true && true        -> true

or
true  || false      -> true
false || false      -> false

not
!true               -> false
!false              -> true
true != false       -> true
true != true        -> false
!(true && false)    -> true
!(true && false)    -> true
```

### Undefined

If a variable is created but not assigned a value, the variable is undefined.

### Null

Null is equal to nothing else in your program. It is not zero, it is not false, it is nothing.

### Symbol

Symbol is a new data type created for the JS update ECMAScript 2015. Symbols are unique and immutable, used for the key in a JS object.


## Type Coercion

Because JavaScript is a loosely typed language, it does a funky thing called type coercion. If we combine data from different types, JavaScript tries to be helpful and make sense of the operation. This can lead to strange and unpredictable behavior and is generally best to avoid.

```
"2" + 2             -> "22"
!3                  -> false
!0                  -> true
true * 9            -> 9
false * 9           -> 0
```

## Variables

Just like in algebra, variables are used to store information. Variables must be declared and assigned a value using a single equals sign.


```
variable declared
var a               -> undefined
var a + 5           -> NaN (not a number)

variable declared and assigned
var a = 2           -> 2
a + 5               -> 7
a * 7               -> 14
a + a               -> 4
var a = null        -> null


variable reassigned
var a = "hello "    -> "hello "
a.length            -> 5
a + a               -> "hello hello "
a + 5               -> "hello 5"

new variable
var b = "world"     -> "world"
a + b               -> "hello world"

new variable using existing variables
var c = a + b       -> "hello world"
a                   -> "hello "
b                   -> "world"
c                   -> "hello world"
```

We have gone over most of the building blocks that compose a JavaScript program. No matter how complex a project you work on, the pieces you use to build it will still be composed of primitive data types and manipulated as variables.


## Challenges

**String Challenges**
- Find the length of a string containing your name
- Does your string include the letter "e"?

**Boolean Challenges (return true or false)**
- Is 34 divided by 3 greater than 67 divided by 2?
- Does 5 evaluate to the same as "5"?
- Does 5 strictly equal "5"?
- Does !3 strictly equal 3?
- Does "LEARN".length strictly equal 5 AND "Student".length strictly equal 7?
- Does "LEARN".length strictly equal 5 OR "Student".length strictly equal 10?

**Variables Challenges**
- Set a variable called favNum equal to your favorite number
- Log your favorite number divided by 2
- Set another variable called otherNum equal to 13
- What is favNum divided by otherNum?
- Save a string as a variable
- Find the length of the string
